<p>Now, we will proceed to the first task that you will complete with the robot. The task environment and the robot are shown below.</p>

<p>In this task, your goal is to move all the boxes to the flag as soon as possible. The boxes are heavy and cannot be lifted alone. So, you will need to work with the robot to pick and move them. The task completes when all the boxes have been dropped at the flag location.</p>

<p>During the task, you can control the human player shown below. The robot moves autonomously. To learn more about how to complete this task, you will complete</p>
