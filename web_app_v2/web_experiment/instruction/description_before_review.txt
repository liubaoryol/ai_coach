We have prompted the Select Destination interface periodically and automatically
to reduce the discrepancy between your actual destination and the marked destination.
However, there is still a chance you forgot to update your destination at right time or
selected the wrong one accidentally.
To reduce incorrect data, we would like you to review the destinations labeled at each time step.
If you think you already provided us with correct destinations at each step, you can skip this review session.
Otherwise, please move to the review page and fix incorrect destinations.
