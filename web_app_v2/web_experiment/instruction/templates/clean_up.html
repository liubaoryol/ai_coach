<div class="explanation">
  <p>Great! You have completed the first three parts of the experiment.</p>

  <p>Now, we will proceed to the second task that you will complete with the robot. The task environment and the robot
    are shown below.</p>

  <p>In this task, your goal is to clean the room by moving all trash bags to the truck as soon as possible. The trash
    bags are light and can be lifted alone. So, you no longer need to wait for the robot to pick and move them. The task
    is completed when all the trash bags have been dropped at the truck location.</p>

  <p>During the task, you can control the human player shown below. The robot moves autonomously. To learn more about
    how to complete this task, you will complete</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A tutorial session, where you will interactively learn about the task.</li>
    <li>Three test sessions, where you need to select your current destination as frequent as possible while performing
      the task.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Letâ€™s begin!</p>
