  <p>In this study, we would like to collect behavioral data according to the destination through gamified tasks.
    The study session is divided into five parts</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>An overview of the study. (1 min)</li>
    <li>A short demographic survey. (1 min)</li>
    <li>Task A: Working with a robot to move boxes in a room. (7-9 min)</li>
    <!-- <ol type="a">
      <li>Tutorial</li>
      <li>Session A1</li>
      <li>Session A2</li>
      <li>Session A3</li>
      <li>Session A4</li>
    </ol> -->
    <li>Task B: Working with a fire truck to rescue people. (7-9 min)</li>
    <!-- <ol type="a">
      <li>Tutorial</li>
      <li>Session B1</li>
      <li>Session B2</li>
      <li>Session B3</li>
      <li>Session B4</li>
    </ol> -->
    <li>A short post-experiment questionnaire. (1-2 min)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    For each of the two tasks, you will be first given a TUTORIAL to describe the task.
    Then, you will complete FOUR actual TASK sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tasks are designed to contain multiple targets to deal with.
    To complete the tasks as efficiently as possible, you may need to change your target during the task.
    Whenever the target is changed in your mind, you are supposed to consciously mark your destination via
    the provided user interface.
    <!-- Your goal is to complete tasks as efficiently as possible in collaboration with your autonomous teammate. -->
    You will learn how to use the user interface in the tutorial.
