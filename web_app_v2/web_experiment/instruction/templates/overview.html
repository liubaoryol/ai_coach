  <p>The study session is divided into five parts</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>An overview of the study. (1-2 min)</li>
    <li>A short demographic survey. (1-2 min)</li>
    <li>Task A: Working with a robot to move boxes in a room. (7-9 min)</li>
    <li>Task B: Working with a robot to clean a room. (7-9 min)</li>
    <li>Task C: Working with a fire truck to rescue people. (7-9 min)</li>
    <li>A short post-experiment questionnaire. (1-2 min)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>For each of the two tasks, you will be first given a tutorial to describe the task. Then, you will complete a set
    of practice sessions followed by the final task. Your goal is to complete these tasks as efficiently as possible in
    collaboration with the robot.</p>
