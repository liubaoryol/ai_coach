<div class="explanation">
  <p>Thank you for completing the survey!</p>

  <p>Now, we will proceed to the first task that you will complete with the robot. The task environment and the robot
    are shown below.</p>

  <p>In this task, your goal is to move all the boxes to the truck as soon as possible. The boxes are heavy and cannot
    be
    lifted alone. So, you will need to work with the robot to pick and move them. The task completes when all the boxes
    have been dropped at the truck location.</p>

  <p>During the task, you can control the human player shown below. The robot moves autonomously. To learn more about
    how to complete this task, you will complete</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A tutorial session, where you will interactively learn about the task.</li>
    <li>Four task sessions, where you need to select your current destination as frequently as possible while completing
      the task.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Letâ€™s begin!</p>
