The purpose of this study is to collect data of actions and the destinations that 
you had in your mind when taking each action.
The true actions that you took to complete the task are easy to collect.
On the other hand, the true destinations cannot be easily collected because it exists only in your mind.
Hence, data of the destinations depend on your faithful participation in,
using the "Destination Selection" interface whenever you change your destination.
We have prompted the "Destination Selection" interface periodically and automatically,
to reduce the discrepancy between your new destination and the marked destination.
However, there is still a chance you forgot to update your destination at right time or
selected the wrong one accidentally.
To reduce invalid data, we would like you to review the destinations labeled at each time step.
This review session is voluntary. 
If you think you already provided us with correct destinations at each step, you can skip this review session.
Otherwise, please move to the review page and fix incorrect destinations.
