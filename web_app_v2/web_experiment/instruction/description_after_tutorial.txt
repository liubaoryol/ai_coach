The purpose of this study is to collect data of actions and the destinations that
you had in your mind when taking each action.
The true actions that you took to complete the task are easy to collect.
On the other hand, the true destinations cannot be easily collected because they exist only in your mind.
Hence, we would really appreciate it if you could faithfully use the Select Destination button, whenever you change your destination.
