## Development

### Style Guide
This project uses a custom Python style guide, which differs from [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) in the following ways:
- Use two-space indentation instead of four-space indentation.
- 80 character line limits rather than 79.

You can format your code according to the style guide using linters (e.g., [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)) and autoformatters (e.g., [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf)).
